HMC-Sim 2.0 CMC Stencil Read Initialization

Adds a stencil read initialization operation which stores the
  stencil initialization settings for a specific stencil config
  in the CMC registers 0-31.

The request payload is 17 FLITs in length, and depending on number
  of array dimension, consists of one of the following:

1-DIMENSIONAL STENCIL:
 -rqst_payload[7:0] : stencil point : the number of cells in the
    stencil to be initialized.
 -rqst_payload[2048:8] : stencil layout : 1d array containing the
    relative positions of each cell within the stencil to be
    initialized.

2-DIMENSIONAL STENCIL:
 -rqst_payload[7:0] : stencil point : the number of cells in the
    stencil to be initialized.
 -rqst_payload[15:8] : array width : the number of array elements
    within each row of the array.
 -rqst_payload[2048:16] : stencil layout : 2d array containing the
    relative positions of each cell within the stencil to be
    initialized.

3-DIMENSIONAL STENCIL:
 -rqst_payload[7:0] : stencil point : the number of cells in the
    stencil to be initialized.
 -rqst_payload[15:8] : array width : the number of array elements
    within each row of the array.
  -rqst_payload[23:16] : array height : the number of array elements
    within each column of the array.
 -rqst_payload[2048:24] : stencil layout : 3d array containing the
    relative positions of each cell within the stencil to be
    initialized.
