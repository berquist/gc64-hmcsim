HMC-Sim 2.0 CMC 1D Stencil Read with 1-Byte Array Elements 

Adds a 1D stencil read operation which reads a set of array values
  as specified by the stencil neighborhood passed as a request packet.
This operation supports the read of a stencil with up to 512 elements.
  Attempting to read a stencil with more elements will return in error.
This operation returns the elements as a collection of 1-16 128-bit
  packets, which taken together form an unordered set of 4-bit array
  elements.
It is assumed that the array being read from is stored contiguously in
  memory. Otherwise, behavior is undefined.
It is assumed that all array elements within the specified neighborhood
  have a value in memory. Otherwise, behavior is undefined.

The request payload is 2 FLITs in length, and consists of:
 -rqst_payload[0] : center-inclusive : 1 if center cell is part of
    stencil neighborhood, 0 otherwise.
 -rqst_payload[3:1] : neighborhood type : marks the general
    characteristics of the stencil neighbrhood layout.
    0) Von Neumann Neighborhood: a stencil containing all cells with
         Manhattan Distance less than or equal to the stencil radius.
    1) Moore Neighborhood: a stencil containing all cells with a
         Chebyshev Distance less than or equal to the stencil radius.
    2) Narrow Von Neumann Neighborhood: a stencil containing all cells
         with a Manhattan Distance less than or equal to the stencil
         radius, whcih also lies along the axis created with the
         the stencil center cell as the origin.
 -rqst_payload[9:4] : Radius (Range) : the maximum distance from the
    center cell which will be included as stencil, as defined in the
    neighborhood type.
 -rqst_payload[127:10] : UNUSED

The response payload is of dynamic length, varying from 1-16 FLITs.
The length of the response payload is determined by the stencil
  layout chosen.
