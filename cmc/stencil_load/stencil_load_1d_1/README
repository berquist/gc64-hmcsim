HMC-Sim 2.0 CMC 2D Stencil Load with 1 Byte Cells 

Adds a 1D stencil load operation which reads 1 byte data elements
  using the CMC code CMC21.
This operation supports the reading of up to 32 1-Byte cells with
  a single call.
This operation assumes the the array that is being read from is
 stored contiguously within memory.

The request payload is 2 FLITs long, and consists of the following:
  -rqst_payload[0] : center-inclusive : 1 if center cell is part of
    stencil, 0 otherwise.
  -rqst_payload[3:1] : Neighborhood Type : determines the general
    characteristics of the stencil layout. Can be one of :
      0) Von Neumann Neighborhood: a stencil containing all cells
           with a Manhattan Distance less than or equal to the
           stencil radius.
      1) Moore Neighborhood: a stencil containing all cells with a
           Chebyshev Distance less than or equal to the stencil
           radius.
      2) Narrow Von Neumann Neighborhood: a stencil containing all
           cells with MAnhattan Distance less than or equal to the
           stencil radius which also lie along the axis created
           with the center cell as the origin.
  -rqst_payload[9:4] : Radius (or range) : determines the maximum
     distance from the center cell which will be used in stencil,
     as defined in the Neighborhood Type.
  -rqst_payload[127:10] : UNUSED
