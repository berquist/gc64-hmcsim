HMC-Sim 2.0 Custom Memory Cube (CMC) Libraries
-------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains individual impementations
of CMC extensions to the base HMC 2.0 specification. Each
directory contains a single CMC library.  Each library
implements a single CMC operation.  The user may
load any number of CMC libraries into a given simulation
providing that their command codes do not conflict.
For examples on how to create new CMC libraries and/or
integrate CMC operations into a simulation, see the
test directory in ../test and/or read the HMC-Sim
2.0 documentation at www.gc64.org.
-------------------------------------------------------
Note on licenses.  All the CMC source code in the
core HMC-Sim 2.0 source tree are subject to the
BSD-style license found at ../LICENSE.  Users of
HMC-Sim may develop, package and release their
own libraries using the CMC interfaces under their
own license restrictions.
