HMC-SIM TODO LIST
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- add simplified api functions

- integration with SST statistics functions

- integration with Kitfox for power/thermal modeling

- revisit hmc register decoding

- add "hmc_init_sku()" to init the sim using a defined config

- decode bank to dram association

- future optimization
  -- keep lists of root devices & child devices

- add cache analysis functions

- faster packet processing

- faster bank conflict detection

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Completed Items:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- better integration with SST: DONE
-- add thermal and power modeling functions: DONE
-- finish the packet processor
  - DONE: make sure and pay attention to the SLID value in the tail
    for response routing
  - DONE: go back through the response routing and make sure this is true
  - DONE: probably done; but make sure

- add warm reset function for JTAG requests
  -- DONE: JTAG pseudo-deprecated given lack of additional info in spec

- util function to determine if device is attached to a host [eg root device]
  -- DONE

- revise physical address decoding : see Table 9: Pg 31
  -- DONE: this means fixing all the decode_vault logic
  -- DONE: add a decode_quad function
  -- DONE: wrap everything up with a top-level function: decode_qv
  -- DONE: make sure all the functions in hmc_clock are correct now

-- finish the hmc_bank_conflict code
  -- DONE: make sure and mark the conflicts with HMC_RQST_CONFLICT
  -- DONE: make sure and figure out the packet type

- add functions to simplify writing the max request width
  -- only support for default addressing modes
  -- DONE : Checkin 119
- add queue reorg function to hmc_clock
  -- DONE
- finalize the bank conflict methdology in hmc_clock_bank_conflicts from hmc_clock.c
  -- look at the total number of banks and use that as the sliding window of possible values
  -- DONE
- update the host device cub id to be represented as num_devices+1
  -- DONE
- build funtions to send/recv packets
  -- DONE
- build functions to dump trace info 
  -- DONE
- build internal routing info for dev to dev xfers
  -- DONE: handled in hmcsim_clock
- add functions and handlers for HMC internal registers  
-- 1) add handlers for request MODE_READ MODE_WRITE packets
-- 2) add side-band functions to access registers 
   -- DONE
-- 3) add macros to decode the spec's notion of a register index versus the internal 
      representation 
   -- DONE
-- 4) add auto setup of config regs within the hmc_init() function 
   -- DONE
-- 5) add to header file 
   -- DONE
- fix case where we have eight quads and four vaults; set pointers accordingly
   -- DONE
- add default config register writing for hmc_init(..) function; 
  -- DONE
- write the feature and version register
  -- do this as a part of configuring the devices
  -- DONE
- fix vault layout in init : see page 31
  -- DONE
